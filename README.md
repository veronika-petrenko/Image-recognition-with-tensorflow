# Image-recognition-with-tensorflow
Final project of Data Science Bootcamp, image recognition with tensorflow.
The dataset used is from Kaggle Google Landmarks https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-2019

There are several files:
- EDA where we discover and filter the dataset
- Image download where we download images onto our computer
- Resize images
- 2 notebooks with neural networks training 
- Camera: a function that returns the prediction from the image given from the user's camera on the computer
